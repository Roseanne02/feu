          <h1>Facts and History</h1>
          <p> The original company, Asia Pacific Computer Technology Center (APCTC), was setup as early as July 1991 by SM Foundation and IBM Philippines. In January 1992, APCTC joined forces with Far Eastern University (FEU) and Intelligent Wave, Inc. (IWI), and set up a computer school, which was subsequently called East Asia Institute of Information Technology.

            Initially, the only course offered was leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science (BS CIS). In 1994, East Asia Institute of Information Technology started to offer courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BS COE).
            
            On September 30, 1998, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) noted the change in the name of East Asia Institute of Computer Technology (EAICT) to East Asia College of Information Technology.
            
            On February 24, 2000, East Asia College of Information Technology was identified by CHED as a Center of Development for Excellence in Information Technology Education.
            
            In 2001, CHED approved the proposal of East Asia College of Information Technology to offer additional courses leading to Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Information Management. Also in 2001, FEU reopened its College of Engineering offering a trimestral (4 years and one term) program, which prepares students for a career in the engineering industry.
            
            In 2003, the FEU-College of Engineering merged with East Asia College of Information Technology's College of Computer Studies to form FEU-East Asia College.
